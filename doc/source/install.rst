Installation
------------

The following installation approaches are listed in order of recommendation.
All but the first of these approaches requires a prior installation of RDKit_.

Option 1: Install with Conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

E3FP is on the `Anaconda distribution`_. Conda is a cross-platform package
manager. This approach is highly recommended as it installs *all* required
packages.

.. code:: bash

    $ conda create -c keiserlab -c rdkit -c sdaxen --name e3fp_env e3fp

.. warning:: Due to a
  `potential bug <https://www.mail-archive.com/rdkit-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg07315.html>`_
  in some versions of conda, rdkit may not import on some systems. If this is
  the case, simply upgrade to the latest version of conda before creating the above
  environment:
  
  .. code:: bash

    conda update conda

To get the latest version of E3FP, follow :ref:`Option 3: Clone the Repository`.

Option 2: Install with Pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install with

   .. code:: bash

       $ pip install e3fp

2. To install the optional Python dependencies, run

   .. code:: bash

       $ pip install mpi4py futures standardiser h5py

Option 3: Clone the Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. Install any of the optional dependencies above.

  .. note:: The easiest way to install the dependencies is with conda using Option 1 above.
            If e3fp is also installed with conda, you will need to uninstall it before
            continuing below with
